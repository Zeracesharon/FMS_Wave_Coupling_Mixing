! This input file provides the adjustable run-time parameters for version 6 of the Modular Ocean Model (MOM6).
! Where appropriate, parameters use usually given in MKS units.

! This particular file is for the example in idealized_hurricane.

! This MOM_input file typically contains only the non-default values that are needed to reproduce this example.
! A full list of parameters for this example can be found in the corresponding MOM_parameter_doc.all file
! which is generated by the model at run-time.

! This file was written by the model and records the non-default parameters used at run-time.

                                ! An integer whose bits encode which restart files are written. Add 2 (bit 1)
                                ! for a time-stamped file, and odd (bit 0) for a non-time-stamped file. A
                                ! non-time-stamped restart file is saved at the end of the run segment for any
                                ! non-negative value.
