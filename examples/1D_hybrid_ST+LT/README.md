This example provides the settings for matched 1D cases using one-way-coupled simulations. The hybrid scheme with LT rescaling is employed. Only the files that differ from 1D_hybrid_ST are included here.

The wave-forcing input file should be linked consistently with the wind-forcing files. Therefore, only srun_20.sh—which is different from the one in 1D_hybrid_ST—is provided here to run the cases.
